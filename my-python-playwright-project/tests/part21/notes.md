# Part 21: Handling React Application Selectors

## Definition
React-based apps often use dynamic classes or IDs, but Playwright can still access inputs using static attributes like `id` or `placeholder`.

## Best Practice:
Use stable attributes like `id`, `placeholder`, `name` rather than dynamic classes.

In this test, we interact with a form on a React-based app using IDs.
